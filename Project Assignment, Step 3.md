Ty’s Personal Fitness Tracker

Purpose:  
Part 1 – MVP - minimum-viable product, i.e., "must have" these in order for the application to be usable at all
The purpose of this project is to track my fitness workout sessions for the week. I plan to exercise 5-6 times per week. It will also give me
the ability to log workouts, complete with timers, weight, sets, reps, calories, and store my exercises, etc.
I will track all my workout sessions in 4 phases: 
1. Warm up sessions

For each phase, I will track each phase:
1.	For the warm-up activity, I will track the activity, time/distance, sets/repetitions, intensity, and an area to capture and special notes. 
2.	For the Strength Training, I will capture the exercises, sets/reps, weight, rest time, area to capture and special notes.
3.	For the cardio training, I will capture the exercises, time/distant, target hour, intensity an area to capture and special notes.
4.	For the cool down activity, I will track the activity, time/distance, sets/repetitions, intensity, and an area to capture and special notes. 
*Intensity: L/M/V=Light/Moderate/Vigorous or E/M/H=Easy/Medium/Hard or Heart Rate
 
Part 2 - Full - "should have"; completion of this category is necessary for a functional, shippable product
Additional features will give me the ability to track my fitness performance goals, calories burned and weight loss, track exercise history, 
stopwatch timer, and a notification to remind me of my goals and prompting me to follow through on them. 

Part 3 - Stretch - "nice to have"; extra features that extend the system's core functionality. Implement if you have time, put on the "coming soon"
 page if not.
 A nutrition feature that include a verified database, unlimited nutrition plans, custom meal options, macro calculator, exercise database with videos, and an option to share accomplishments on social media once they have completed an activity or goal.
